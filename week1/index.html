            <p>
                I'm Kristen, a third-year Cognitive Science major and Digital Humanities minor at UCLA.
                My main goal as a critical digital map maker is to serve underrepresented minority groups 
                and communities through community-based and ethical uses of GIS and data. 
                I  aim to learn more about how to use mapping and data for long-term and sustainable social change
                through taking Asian-American 191A. <br>

            <h3>Interests</h3>

            <p>
                My academic interests include cognitive science, psychology, and digital humanities. In terms of psychology,
                I'm especially interested in the areas of social, developmental, and evolutionary psychology.<br>
                Outside of school, my interests include reading, crocheting, and trying new foods. I also enjoy
                watching new TV shows and movies! <br> <br>
